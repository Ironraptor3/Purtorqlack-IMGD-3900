Where to go from here:

In the refined version, in addition to iteration based on class feedback, we plan
on having:

1) Levels, each with their own powerup and exit.
2) Randomly generated level layouts
3) Many more enemies (one for each type of piece)
4) Different point values for different enemies
5) More powerups

Comments:

These changes to the game should be possible given the current structure of the game.
